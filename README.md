# EducationPlatform
Education Platform is a WPF.NET 6.0 app designed to manage a highschool. It utilizes Entity Framework Core to interact with the database that stores data such as students, teachers, grades, specializations and many other. 
The application offers a role-based access control system, allowing the users to have different roles such as student, teacher, class master, and administrator.  The administrator role enables users to perform CRUD operations on all tables, granting full control over the system. Teachers and class masters have the ability to modify data specific to the students they teach, allowing them to manage and update relevant information. On the other hand, students have a limited view-only access, where they can only access and view data that pertains to them personally.
